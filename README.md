# PythonLabs
Choose one of the following Cases, clone the lab, work out your case, then upload your solution to the lab page, state your name and case number.

1. Using List and Dictionaries in Python, write a program that reads in a Python source code file and counts the occurrence of each keyword in the file. Your program should prompt the user to enter the Python source code filename.

2. Write a program that will count the number of characters, words, and lines in a file. Words are separated by a whitespace character. Your program should prompt the user to enter a filename. 

3. Suppose that a text file contains an unspecified number of scores. Write a program that reads the scores from the file and displays their total and average. Scores are separated by blanks. Your program should prompt the user to enter a filename.


4.Write a program that writes 100 integers created randomly into a file. Integers are separated by a space in the file. Read the data back from the file and display the sorted data. Your program should prompt the user to enter a filename. If the file already exists, do not override it. 

5. Suppose a file is encrypted using the scheme in Exercise 13.8. (page No.453) Write a program to decode an encrypted file. Your program should prompt the user to enter an input filename and an output filename and should save the unencrypted version of the input file to the output file.
